## Multi-faceted Analysis and Classification of Spotify Tracks 

In this project, I utilized the "Spotify Tracks Dataset" available on public domain at [Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/maharshipandya/spotify-tracks-dataset).

I used standard machine learning techniques such as data exploration and visualization, followed by statistical methods such as doing a PCA and a correlation heatmap analysis. Afterwards, I created a recommendation system that fetches the most similar track to the user's chosen track. Additionally, I compared classification methods based on audio features provided by the dataset such as Random Forest, Gradient boosting, FNN and MLP. I concluded the analysis by analysing one property - "popularity", in order to find what makes a track popular and what influences this. Lastly, I did a genre-based analysis by finding the most energetic, most danceable genres and genres with the highest valence. 

I also created a report on the findings of an in depth analysis to accompany the code. The code is available on a Google Colab notebook and a python script. 

To view the full project, I'd personally suggest you to please view the Jupyter notebook titled `spotify.ipynb` file for the code with commentary and visualizations for the best experience.
